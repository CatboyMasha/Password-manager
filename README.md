# C++ Password Manager
It does what it says, it's a password manager.
The code kinda sucks because i just threw it together but it works decently fine :3

## How to use
The program has 5 built in commands, those are the following.

> **mkpw \<name\>**:
Creates a new password with the given name.

> **listpw / pwlist**:
Lists all saved passwords.

> **getpw \<name\>**:
Retrieves the given password from storage.

> **rmpw \<name\>**:
Deletes the given password from storage.

> **exit**:
Exits the program.


## How to compile
To compile make sure you have g++ installed on your machine.
It comes pre-installed on most linux and windows devices.

Navigate to your install location,
then run the following lines in your terminal:

```shell
g++ main.cpp -o main
./main
```

Now the program should be installed on your device, if you need any help you can contact me on my socials and i will try my best to help :3


## Code usage

All my code is free to use for non-malicious purposes.
